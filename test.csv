It is closest to the lively and eclectic neighborhood of Logan Square, 15 minutes from downtown, and easy access to the lakefront as well as surrounding neighborhoods. Have a great home base while exploring all of what Chicago has to offer! The space is super cozy, and since it is just me the living space essentially feels like a separate room. I work Wednesday through Sunday, but am available during my off time to show you the wonders of Chicago. There is also public transportation near by for any solo exploration. ""Cheap eats and bike-friendly streets. Gourmet coffee, scruffy dive bars and artisanal cocktail lounges. Some may say it's a recipe for a hipster haven but there's a proud, working-class sensibility that keeps this Northwest Side neighborhood grounded. In Logan Square, the strong neighborly connection is evident all around, from active preservation groups to community gardens and a locally-run farmers market.

This suite is very much like a studio apartment with its private bathroom, seating, microwave, coffee maker and mini-fridge. There is also a television with Chrome or similar set top box hookup. Brooklyn College Manor is a pre-war house. Long ago, there was a mansion nearby, and this home was built separately to accommodate the staff and horses which served the mansion. The house and the master suite are adorned with original detail.  Your Bathroom and Sleeping/Living area is completely separate from the rest of the house by a door with a lock. You'll get a code for the keypad to the front door. You enter your room by going upstairs from a foyer and through a common hall. A room key as well as a front door key will be left in the Master suite for you, so you can lock your room door, and use a traditional key on the front door.
