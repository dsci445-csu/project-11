# project-11
Class project for group 11 in DSCI445 @ CSU

We based on project off of a past Kaggle competition about AirBnB listings in major US cities.  The data provided by the competition has over 78,000 entries so due to size restrictions, the training data used for this project is a 18,000 row sample of the original data and the test data is a 3,000 row sample of the original data.
