# Predicting-Soccer-Match-Outcome
## Project Overview
Soccer is a popular sport around the world. Millions of people, whether they play or not, love to participate in predicting match outcomes using the statistics from each team. For our project we want to predict the match outcomes using data from over 25,000 matches, over 10,000 players, and 11 European countries. All of these statistics are from the 2008 to 2016 seasons, and we will use them to predict the 2017 season, then compare our results with the actual results.
