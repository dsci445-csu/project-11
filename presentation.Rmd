##Overview
The goal of our project was to predict the match outcome (home win, tie, home loss) of the home team in 2017 soccer season using data from the seasons 2008-2016. We split this up into three tasks:
-Task 1: Data preparation
-Task 2: Classification
  -Predicting match outcomes (win at home, tie, loss at home)
-Task 3: Regression
  -Predicting the number of goals scored in a match

##Data
We used the European soccer database from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer/data). This database includes:
-data from over 25,000 matches
-over 10,000 players
-11 European countries
-data from the 2008-2016 seasons


##Data Preparation
Data is split into two groups:
-Train data: 2008-2016 seasons
-Test data: 2017 season
